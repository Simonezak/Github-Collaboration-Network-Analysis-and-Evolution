# Github Collaboration Network Analysis and Evolution
In this project we want to analyze the structure and evultuion of the Collaboration Network between users on Github.

## Research questions
In particular, the research questions we want to answer are:
1) How is the Collaboration Network among GitHub users structured?
2) How does the Collaboration Network evolve over time? Are collaborations typically recurrent or users tend to seek new collaborators?

## Analyses
To answer the first question, we performed the following analyses:
- Overview of Basic network metrics
- Scale-Free property test
- Community detection
- Centrality metrics
- Degree Assortativity, Clustering Coefficient

To answer the second, on the other hand:
- Creation of Temporal graph
- Comparison of graph growth over time
- Comparison of network metrics across time periods
- Comparison of community structures over time
- Collaboration Recurrency analysis
